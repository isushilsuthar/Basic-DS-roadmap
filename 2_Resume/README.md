# 📄 Resume

Welcome! This folder contains a copy of my resume and a few tips based on mistakes I made early on. If you're just starting out or looking to improve yours, these will help avoid common pitfalls.

## ❌ Mistakes I Made While Creating Mine:

- **❌ Wrote long paragraphs instead of using crisp bullet points.**  
  → Use bullets to keep things scannable.

- **❌ Didn’t quantify my impact.**  
  → Always include numbers: “Improved accuracy by 12%”, “Processed 200K rows”, etc.

- **❌ Missed linking projects to GitHub.**  
  → Always add live links or repos if possible.

- **❌ Used one generic resume for all roles.**  
  → Tailor your resume based on the job description & required skills.
