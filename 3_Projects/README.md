## 💡 Why You Should Build Your Own Projects

- **Interviewers know when it's copied.**  
  If you can't answer simple questions about your own project, it's a red flag.
  > 🚫 **Warning:** Please don’t copy-paste my projects. They are meant to inspire and guide you, not to be cloned. Interviewers can easily spot copied work — build your own, learn deeply, and stand out!


- **Clarity on the "what", "why", and "how".**  
  Know what algorithm you used, *why* you used it, *how* it works, and what would happen if you used something else.

- **Confidence during interviews.**  
  Real ownership means you can explain edge cases, metrics, and trade-offs confidently.

- ✅ Choose an algorithm you can explain clearly.
- ✅ Include basic **EDA, modeling, metrics**, and **visualizations**.
