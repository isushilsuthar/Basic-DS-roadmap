Hey! I'm an **Electrical Engineering graduate from IIT BHU Varanasi**. 

- ❌ Couldn't crack a job on campus.  
- 📉 Faced **250+ rejections**.  
- ✅ Cracked my **first job off-campus** with a package **better than my college's base average**.  
- 🧠 3 months later, I cracked another — **Data Scientist 1 @ Mastercard**.
- I created this repo in response to the DMs I have been getting.
  > ⚠️ This is not an exhaustive list of everything in ML or the complete set of resources you'll ever need — it's a curated starting point.
